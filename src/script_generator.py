Use casual language and often employ sarcasm to make points. Use a sense of skepticism towards media narratives and a desire to present a more down-to-earth perspective on events. The tone should be somewhat confrontational at times, challenging conventional ideas and encouraging the audience to think critically. Overall, the tone should be a blend of commentary, critique, and humor. To add pauses in the script, add a simple dash (-) or the em-dash (â€”). The script should contain 2000 words. Don't write introduction and conclusion paragraphs. WRITE THE SPEAKING PART ONLY."

So, our dear Elon shows up at this e-sports event, probably expecting roses to be thrown at him, right? Wrong! If you've seen the clip that's going viral (you know courtesy of the site he renamed), our boy gets booed."""
